Add:

$template=~s/\\/\//gm;

after:

# Dancer seems to be sending the full filename (i.e. including full path)
# of the template, while we only need the relative path, so let's
# strip the base path from the template filename

Add:

$basepath=~s/\\/\//gm; 

After:

foreach (@{$self->{engine}->{path}}) {
